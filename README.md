# NFL-Data-Analysis-with-Python-

Overview:
Wise people say there is yet-to-be-discovered rationale/intelligence behind most intuitive anticipations. This project dives into the realm of tackling analysis, focusing on Union Rugby and its parallels with NFL (National Football League). The aim is to review existing knowledge on success factors in Union Rugby tackling and leverage data-driven insights from the NFL to identify metrics suitable for evaluating tackles in both sports.

Objectives:
Scrutinize previous findings on tackling range and player-in-tackle evaluation in Union Rugby.
Utilize NFL data-driven insights to validate metrics for tackling evaluation in Union Rugby and assess their applicability to NFL tackle evaluation.

Methodology:
The research extends its scope by incorporating data from the 2024 Data Bowl. The dataset includes tracking data provided by the NFL Next Gen Stats team, covering Weeks 1-9 of the 2022 NFL season. Key variables for analysis are identified, including player location, speed, acceleration, and football location. Additionally, Pro Football Focus (PFF) contributes the pff_missedTackles column in the tackles data, adding a layer of scouting data to the analysis. NFL advanced stats such as expected points and win probability further enhance the depth of the study.
